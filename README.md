# ECS152A_Servers
Implement a web server and a proxy server that allow user to access files through custom localhost port number using TCP.

This project is an brief implementation of web servers. Compile and run them in terminal and access a website by type localhost:6789/google.com in your browser to access google.com through localhost port number 6789 and web server. Type localhost:8888/localhost:6789/google.com in your browser to use both web and proxy server to improve server's performance by caching websites that you accessed.
